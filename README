T5.2 - Monitoring of applications (m1-m18)
Task leader: IRIT 
Partners involved: PSNC, USTUTT-HLRS

This task focuses on extending state-of-the-art existing monitoring 
infrastructures (such as Ganglia). Important application related information 
are needed to take smart and relevant decisions for the computing module 
operation. These missing information include: the precise communication 
patterns between applications; fine-grained application-related information 
about energy consumption and heat production at the node level.

Statistical analysis of indirect measurements will provide mathematical models 
for deriving instantaneous power consumption of processes. These indirect 
measurements will be based on IRIT expertise of low level system monitoring and 
analysis (performance counters, kernel-level information)[DaCosta-2010] and 
hardware monitoring possibilities (as Chair of the hardware possibilites 
workpackage -WP1- of the Cost Action IC0804 on Energy Efficiency in large scale 
distributed systems)

This project task generates several distinct tools and programs:
- eclib.a:	Energy Consumption Library
- ecdaq:	Energy Consumption Data Acquisition
- ecps:		Energy Consumption Process Snapshot
- ectop:	Top Energy Consuming Applications
- ecxtop:	Graphical User Interface for ectop
- valgreen

Compiling the project

The user need to change the path to its kernel source folder on the Makefile:
KERNEL_SRC=<path_to_kernel_source>

To compile the entire plataform:
$ make build

To compile only the library:
$ make build_lib
